Areas of Improvement:
1. Algebraic Manipulation: The student correctly worked through most of the algebraic manipulation necessary for problems 1, 2, and 4, showing an understanding of how to apply linear equations. However, there might be an understanding gap when it comes to setting up more complex word problems involving rates and percentages as seen in problem 5 and problem 6. The incorrect responses suggest a misunderstanding of how to translate word problems into mathematical equations, especially in scenarios involving rates (work rate, speed, etc.) and combining different contributions to a total effect.
2. Systems of Equations: The student's response to problem 3 ("I don't understand") indicates a lack of confidence or knowledge in dealing with systems of equations, which could be crucial for solving real-world problems through algebra. This area is fundamental; thus, reinforcing the student's ability to set up and solve systems of equations would be beneficial.
3. Word Problem Translation: There is evidence of struggle in translating word problems into mathematical equations in problems 5 and 6, where the student did not correctly identify the mathematical relationships described in the problems. This suggests an area for improvement in understanding and applying the concept of work rates and combining rates effectively to solve problems.

List of Areas to Review:
1. **Setting Up Equations from Word Problems**: Practice turning word problems into mathematical expressions. This skill is important across many types of problems, including those involving percentages, distances, rates, and work problems.
2. **Solving Systems of Equations**: Revisit the methods for solving systems of equations—both graphically and algebraically. This includes understanding how to represent real-world situations with multiple variables and equations.
3. **Algebraic Expressions and Manipulations**: Strengthen skills in algebraic manipulation, including expanding, factoring, and simplifying expressions. Ensure a solid understanding of how to manipulate equations to isolate variables, especially in complex scenarios.
4. **Rates and Ratios**: It’s clear from the mistakes on the homework that there is a need to better understand problems involving rates (e.g., speed, work rates). Practice problems that involve calculating rates, combining rates, and understanding the concept of inverse proportions (as seen in work rate problems).
5. **Word Problems involving Percentages**: The incorrect solving of problem #1 indicates a need to practice more with percentages, including markup, markdown, and finding original prices after discounts or sales.

By focusing on these areas, the student should be able to strengthen their understanding of pre-calculus concepts, leading to better performance in solving a wide array of algebraic problems.
